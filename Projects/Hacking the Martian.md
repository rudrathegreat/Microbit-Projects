# BBC Micro:bit Projects
## Hacking the Martian
### Abstract

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have been exploring technologies used in "The Martian" movie. We made four projects replicating scenes from the movie:

1) Making a remote controlled Mars Rover - We used one BBC Microbit to control the motors. We used a second Microbit to transmit signals wirelessly.

2) Sending and receiving ASCII messages - We used one Microbit to transmit and one to receive. The receiver was connected to a servo motor that pointed to hexadecimal numbers from 0 to F.

3) Controlling a robotic arm - Two Microbits controlled the arm, and one Microbit transmitted instructions. During this project we developed an understanding of teamwork because we had multiple teams working on the one project.

4) Firing thrusters on the Mars Ascent Vehicle - We combined the skills we learned from the previous projects. We used the Microbit accelerometer to calculate the tilt angle and to fire the thruster.

### Design and Features

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASCII Challenge - We encoded our messages into hexadecimal with an ASCII table. It was a new experience for us.

Robotic arm - The robotic arm had 4 degrees of freedom: gripper, wrist, elbow and shoulder. One Microbit controlled the gripper and shoulder, and the other the wrist and elbow.

Mars Ascent Vehicle Thruster - For the thruster we used an Arduino electric fan module controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

ASCII Communication - Another way of communicating with others using microcontrollers to move the motor.

### Aim

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are always looking for more engaging pathways for learning. "The Martian" movie is very captivating to audiences. Using "The Martian" as a theme makes coding even more interesting. It really feels like we are part of the engineering team contributing to the next mission to Mars.
